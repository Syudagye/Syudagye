# Hey :3

I'm a french degenerate IT student who found a better profile picture *(and it's home-made, and it's cool, don't say otherwise >:3)*.

## Main projects

*none for now, sadly ;w;*

## Currently contributing to

- [XdotRS](https://github.com/XdotRS) - Pure Rust implementation of the X11 protocol. Helping a bit here.
- [LeftWM](https://github.com/leftwm/leftwm) - "A window manager for adventurers". A really cool project, check it out !

## The RICE üçö

- [nixfiles](https://github.com/Syudagye/nixfiles) - dotfiles and configurations for my NixOS systems
- [nvim-config](https://github.com/Syudagye/nvim-config) - Config files for my Neovim/Neovide editor (100% home-made too !)
- [dotfiles](https://github.com/Syudagye/dotfiles) - Kinda outdated, but those are my dotfiles (will maybe be replaced by `nixfiles`)
- [leftwm-sunset](https://github.com/Syudagye/leftwm-sunset) - My old theme for leftwm, really outdated tbh, you can use it if you want, but expect some issue !

## Past attempts at things

- [rust-hellokernel](https://github.com/Syudagye/rust-hellokernel) - Simple linux kernel module in rust
- [GD Collab Manager](https://github.com/Syudagye/GDCollabManager) - A website and a discord bot to easily manage collabs for Geometry Dash
