# Hey :3

I'm a french underaged degenerate developer who needs to find better profile pictures.

## Main projects

- [GD Collab Manager](https://github.com/Syudagye/GDCollabManager) - A website and a discord bot to easily manage collabs for Geometry Dash

## Cool projects

- [GD Pythagorean](https://github.com/gd-Pythagorean) - "Home to the Euclidean project." (Basically things around gd.)

## Maybe future projects

- A discord cli for linux in Rust (maybe using [pronote-api](https://github.com/Litarvan/pronote-api) or making my own rust crate)
- A Java api for osu!api v2
- DashSave - A save file/backup manager and level exporter/importer for Geometry Dash (Maybe in Rust using [dash-rs](https://github.com/stadust/dash-rs))

### Social thing

- Discord: @Syudagye#2693
- [Odysee/LBRY](https://odysee.com/@Syudagye:4e835668985480fd43683862e327981c7f965cc4) (not really coding related lol)
